Develop a simple smart contract 📄where Party A (the depositor 💷) initializes the contract and deposits some amount of Ether while deploying the contract. Party B's address is provided during contract deployment. Once Party B calls the releaseFunds function (can only be called by Party B) and the condition is met (in this case, it's a simple boolean check ➡️ define a bool and change its value), the deposited funds are transferred to Party B and also a return function to know how much is deposited.
